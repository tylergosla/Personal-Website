        <p> The purpose of this page is to tell the story of who I am and how I came to be interested in coding and project management of software development. The webpage is more toward showing my coding skill, but I love the two equally and thought it should be mentioned. The goal, when creating this project, was to see how quickly I could produce an 'about me' web-page with no experience and with a heavy amount of detail and code. Some of the information within this page may come across as 'over-sharing,' but the information is not the point of this page; it's just a bunch of filler.  

Growing up, I had no idea what I wanted to be or do. My father was a labor worker, and my mother was a stay at home mom who re-married a political science major who managed, later directed, at Ford. My step dad was very politically correct and had a respectable and disciplined sense of character and my dad was a self-dignified man that needn't any approval from anyone to be who he wanted to be; also very respectable and one of the hardest working, most talented, and artistic people you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting.
From my dad, I gained some artistic ability and work ethic. From my step dad; work ethic, time management, and professionalism. My mother taught me a thing or two about organization, cleanliness, and interpersonal communication. She can carry on a conversation with anyone, regardless of what they do or where they're from. 
Putting these characteristics together, along with others I've learned and strengthened over my developmental years, I still graduated high school not sure of what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. You grow up hearing so many stories about how most people go through college changing their major more than once and then change careers just as many times, if not more. I went from Army, to General Manager, Sales, Taxes, Food Distribution Services, to Program Management Consultant. In college, I started out with a general studies, to medical technician, x-ray tech, biology(pre-med), human resource management, accounting, and information systems technology. 
So, what lead me to technology? 
Growing up, I have always been fascinated by the way things work; how electricals are attached to mechanicals with operational capabilities. I always viewed technology as something to increase ease of use or as something resourceful that could be used for entertainment/fun. I never made the internal connections that it could be an industry career pathway. There is no doubt that it was something talked about in school throughout the many classes we have to take, but lets be honest, my priorities in school didnâ€™t include looking ahead until the very last minute. The challenge of figuring out what I wanted to be was exacerbated by the fact that I never prepared myself enough to be ready for that kind of decision. Fast forwarding through more needless detail, I got a job working for PCUBED as a project manager. The job is challenging and I'm constantly learning new things. If I have learned anything about what makes a job worth having, it's the people you work with. If the people suck, the job is going to suck.
